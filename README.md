# Build Historical Weather Data API Using Python

## Project Description

**Overview :**  
The Historical Weather Data API project aims to provide users with access to historical temperature data based on specific dates and weather stations. The API allows users to retrieve temperature information for a given station and date, view all data for a particular station across all dates, and obtain all data for a specific station within a particular year.

**Challenges :**  
Build The Historical Weather Data using python and the Flask framework to create a RESTful API that interacts with historical weather datasets.

## Project Goal

The project aims to to provide users with access to historical temperature data based on specific dates and weather stations.
